CUDA is a parallel computing platform and API model created and developed by Nvidia, which enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of GPUs


Versions
--------
Multiple CUDA versions are available through the module system


Environment
-----------
The CUDA environment is managed through the modules, which set all the environment variables needed.  The availability of different versions can be checked with ::

  module avail cuda

The environment set by a particular module can be inspected, *e.g.* ::

  module show cuda/9.0
